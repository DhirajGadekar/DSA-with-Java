Que 17 : Find all Pairs with given Sum
	Given two unsorted arrays A of size N and B of size M of distinct elements, the task is to
	find all pairs from both arrays whose sum is equal to X.
	Note: All pairs should be printed in increasing order of u. For eg. for two pairs (u1,v1)
	      and (u2,v2), if u1 < u2 then (u1,v1) should be printed first else second.

	Example 1:
		Input:
			A[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
			B[] = {5, 6, 3, 4, 8}
			X=9
		Output:
			1 8
			4 5
			5 4
		Explanation: (1, 8), (4, 5), (5, 4) are the pairs which sum to 9.

	Example 2:
		Input:
			A[] = {-1, -2, 4, -6, 5, 7}
			B[] = {6, 3, 4, 0}
			X=8
		Output:
			4 4
			5 3
	
	Expected Time Complexity: O(NLog(N))
	Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
	Constraints:
		1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^6
		-10^6 ≤ X, A[i], B[i] ≤ 10^6
