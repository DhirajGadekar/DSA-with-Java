/*
30] Find the closest number
	Given an array of sorted integers. The task is to find the closest value to the given
	number in the array. Arrays may contain duplicate values.
	Note: If the difference is same for two values print the value which is greater than
	      the given number.
	
	Example 1:
		Input : Arr[] = {1, 3, 6, 7} and K = 4
		Output : 3
		Explanation:
			We have an array [1, 3, 6, 7] and the target is 4. If we look at the absolute
			difference of target with every element of an array we will get [ |1-4|, |3-4|,
			|6-4|, |7-4| ].
			So, the closest number is 3.
		
	Example 2:
		Input : Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}, K = 4
		Output : 5

	Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N)).
	Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
	
	Constraints:
		1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
		1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5
		1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5
